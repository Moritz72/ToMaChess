INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD FROM SOURCE  
  
1. Install Python 3.11.1 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ (other versions might work as well)  
2. Add the path of the python installation as well as of pip to your PATH system variable (e.g. C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311 and C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts)  
3. Install PyInstaller 5.10.1 via pip with the command "pip install PyInstaller==5.10.1"  
4. Run the "build.bat" file in this folder and wait until it finishes.  
  
If successful, you will find a folder "ToMaChess" in this directory matching the one you would get by installing the corresponding release at https://github.com/Moritz72/ToMaChess/releases.
